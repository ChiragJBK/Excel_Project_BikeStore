# Excel_Project_BikeStore
Hello, In this Excel_Project_BikeStore. I had worked on a small public Bike Store dataset.
In this dataset I had cleaned the data and formatted the data for analysis. Then Analysis through Pivot Table and Pivot Charts. 
Through this dataset try to solve normal business questions Like: **What Age of People's like to buy the bike most? Which Gender buys the Bike most? What Education Background we should target in order to increase our sales? and Which Income Group with Distance of miles buys most? **
All this type of questions were solved with the help of some interactive dashboards. 
When you click my project file it will say View raw (Sorry about that, but we canâ€™t show files that are this big right now.) something like this. Just simply click view raw then it download the file. EVERY SHEET OF THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN SHARED THANK YOU.
